## Details

### You will learn
Destinations are used for the outbound communication of your application to a remote system (which can be a cloud or on-premise system). You will create a destination by giving it a name, URL of the remote system or service, the authentication type, and some other configuration data.

The data source you will use in this tutorial series is called "Northwind", which is a publicly accessible OData source hosted by <http://www.odata.org>:

Northwind comes in several versions.  The tutorials currently use either V2 (<http://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/>) or V3 (<http://services.odata.org/V3/Northwind/Northwind.svc/>).  To support both versions, and other versions that may be added later, you will create a generic connection to the Northwind service.  The exact path - and exact version - will be configured in later tutorials.

### Time to Complete
**less than 5 minutes**
