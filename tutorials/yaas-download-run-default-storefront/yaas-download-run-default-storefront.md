Clone the YaaS StoreFront:

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Download dependencies)] ￼

Use Node's package manager to download the dependencies:

- The YaaS StoreFront includes `npm`, **Node.js**'s package manager, for downloading dependent packages.
- Run `npm install` to download all the packages the Storefront depends on.  The console should show `npm` downloading many dependencies; confirm this is the case.
