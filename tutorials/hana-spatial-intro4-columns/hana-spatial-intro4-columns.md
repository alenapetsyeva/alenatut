## Prerequisites  
- **Proficiency:** Beginner
- **Tutorials:** [Intro to SAP HANA Spatial: Polygons](http://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hana-spatial-intro3-polygon.html)

## Next Steps

## Details
### You will learn  
In previous tutorials you learned how to create spatial objects and run selected methods to perform some calculations using them. Now it's time to learn how to store, retrieve and process spatial data in SAP HANA tables. In addition, you will learn about the Spatial type hierarchy.

### Time to Complete
**10 Min**.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create a schema)]

For the purpose of this tutorial, create a schema `TESTSGEO` or use any other schema in your instance, where you have privileges for creating tables.

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA TESTSGEO;
SET SCHEMA TESTSGEO;
```

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Review spatial types)]

The following spatial types can be used in column tables in SAP HANA:
- `ST_POINT`,
- `ST_GEOMETRY`.

>Spatial columns are not supported in SAP HANA row tables.

The column type `ST_GEOMETRY` supports multidimensional spatial data for the following spatial data types: `ST_CircularString`, `ST_GeometryCollection`, `ST_LineString`, `ST_MultiLineString`, `ST_MultiPoint`, `ST_MultiPolygon`, `ST_Point`, and `ST_Polygon`.

`ST_GEOMETRY` is a core component of the SQL Multimedia (`SQL/MM`) standard for storing and accessing geospatial data. `SQL-MM` follows an object-oriented approach. **Geometry** is the overarching type for objects such as points, strings, and polygons. The geometry type is the supertype for all supported spatial data types.

The following diagram is taken from official SAP HANA Spatial Reference Guide and illustrates the hierarchy of the `ST_Geometry` data types:

![Spatial hierarchy](spatial0401.png)

Object-oriented properties of spatial data types:
- A subtype (or derived type) is more specific than its supertype (or base type).
- A subtype inherits all methods from all supertypes. For example, `ST_Polygon` values can call methods defined for the `ST_Geometry`.
- A value of a subtype can be automatically converted to any of its supertypes. For example, an `ST_Point` value can be used where an `ST_Geometry` parameter is required.
- A column or variable of type `ST_Geometry` can store spatial values of any type.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Load data into table)]

Create and load data into the `SpatialShapes` table. This example is taken from the SAP HANA Spatial Reference, so that you can run exercises from the official help as well.

```sql
CREATE COLUMN TABLE SpatialShapes
(
ShapeID integer,
 shape ST_GEOMETRY
);

-- a set of points
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(1,  NEW ST_POINT('POINT(2.5 3.0)'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(2,  NEW ST_POINT('POINT(3.0 4.5)'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(3,  NEW ST_POINT('POINT(3.0 6.0)'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(4,  NEW ST_POINT('POINT(4.0 6.0)'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(5,  NEW ST_POINT());

-- a set of linestrings
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(6,  NEW ST_LINESTRING('LINESTRING(3.0 3.0, 5.0 4.0, 6.0 3.0)'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(7,  NEW ST_LINESTRING('LINESTRING(4.0 4.0, 6.0 5.0, 7.0 4.0)'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(8,  NEW ST_LINESTRING('LINESTRING(7.0 5.0, 9.0 7.0)'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(9,  NEW ST_LINESTRING('LINESTRING(7.0 3.0, 8.0 5.0)'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(10,  NEW ST_LINESTRING());

-- a set of polygons
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(11, NEW ST_POLYGON('POLYGON((6.0 7.0, 10.0 3.0, 10.0 10.0, 6.0 7.0))'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(12, NEW ST_POLYGON('POLYGON((4.0 5.0, 5.0 3.0, 6.0 5.0, 4.0 5.0))'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(13, NEW ST_POLYGON('POLYGON((1.0 1.0, 1.0 6.0, 6.0 6.0, 6.0 1.0, 1.0 1.0))'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(14, NEW ST_POLYGON('POLYGON((1.0 3.0, 1.0 4.0, 5.0 4.0, 5.0 3.0, 1.0 3.0))'));
INSERT INTO SpatialShapes VALUES(15, NEW ST_POLYGON());
```

Now, check the shapes you loaded, including types of geometries and which geometry values represent empty sets.

```sql
SELECT SHAPEID, SHAPE.ST_asWKT(), SHAPE.ST_GeometryType(), SHAPE.ST_isEmpty()
FROM SPATIALSHAPES;
```

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Review aggregation methods)]

When you need to combine multiple shapes into one you can use different set operations and aggregation methods.

Aggregation methods are executed on spatial columns of tables in SAP HANA.

`ST_UnionAggr()` returns the spatial union of all of the geometries in a group.

```sql
SELECT ST_UnionAggr(SHAPE).ST_asWKT() as UnionAggr
FROM SPATIALSHAPES
WHERE SHAPE.ST_isEmpty()=0 and SHAPE.ST_GeometryType() = 'ST_LineString';
```

![LineString Union](spatial0403.jpg)

Presented graphically, it looks like the diagram below:

![LineString Union SVG](spatial0404.jpg)

Also note that spatial predicates were used in the query above to select only geometries of type `LineString` type and only those that are not empty.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Additional aggregation methods)]

Two more important aggregate methods are
- `ST_ConvexHullAggr()` which returns the convex hull for all of the geometries in a group, known as "rubber band" method,
- `ST_EnvelopeAggr()` which returns the bounding rectangle for all of the geometries in a group.

Execute this query to best illustrate both types of aggregations. It uses the set operation method `ST_Union()` to return the geometry value that represents the point set union of two geometries.

```sql
SELECT
ST_ConvexHullAggr(SHAPE).ST_Boundary().ST_Union(ST_UnionAggr(SHAPE)).ST_asWKT() as ConvexHullAggr,
ST_EnvelopeAggr(SHAPE).ST_Boundary().ST_Union(ST_UnionAggr(SHAPE)).ST_asWKT() as EnvelopeAggr
FROM SPATIALSHAPES
WHERE SHAPE.ST_isEmpty()=0 and SHAPE.ST_GeometryType() = 'ST_LineString';
```

Please note the use of the `ST_Boundary()` method to convert a polygon (which is a result of the aggregation) into just a curve surrounding the shape, so that the combined geometries are all visible.

![Other type of aggregations](spatial0405.jpg)

Seeing is believing, so here are the graphical outputs (with slightly modified SVG to draw the shapes of the aggregates in red)

The result of `ST_ConvexHullAggr()`:

![result of ST_ConvexHullAggr()](spatial0406.jpg)

And the result of `ST_EnvelopeAggr()`:
