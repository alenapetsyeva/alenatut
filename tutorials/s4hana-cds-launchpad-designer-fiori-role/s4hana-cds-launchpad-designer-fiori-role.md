[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Access the Fiori Launchpad Designer)]

Access the Fiori Launchpad Designer by opening the welcome page that came with S/4HANA trial landscape.

![Launchpad1 ](Lauchnpad1png.png)

From the above welcome page, click on the link (1 in the screenshot above) to access the Login screen of the Fiori Launchpad Designer.

![Launchpad2](Lauchnpad2.png)

Start the Fiori Launchpad Logon and log on to the preconfigured system with the following:
- User:     `S4H`
- Password: `Welcome1`
- Client:   `100`

Then click the **Log On** button.

Now you have to append the URL to the Fiori Launchpad Designer to SAP Launchpad URL. The part that needs to be appended is this:

`/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/arsrvc_upb_admn/main.html`

![Launchpad3](Lauchnpad3.png)

Click **Enter**.

You will now see many tiles because new profiles were already assigned to the user `S4H`.

You can open the customization scope by appending  the following to the URL :
`?scope=CUST`

The Configuration scope can be accessed by appending `?scope=CONF` to the URL. It is for system-specific settings.
