You will learn how to create your own YaaS project. This project will provide back-end support for a YaaS Storefront that you be creating in the next tutorial. The starting point is the Builder which is the back-office client of YaaS. The Builder's main functionalities are the orchestration of YaaS Organizations, Projects and Packages, and the maintenance and management of some billing and sales data. You will also learn about the YaaS Market where you can subscribe to different packages of your choice.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Package subscriptions)] ￼

SAP Hybris offers various YaaS functionalities grouped in to packages. Packages include a set of micro services and maintenance user interfaces called Builder modules. Each package has its distinct value proposition as well as a customer segment it addresses.   Your YaaS Project can use these packages if it first subscribes to them.  In order to support a YaaS storefront, your YaaS Project needs the functionality of 7 packages, so you need to subscribe to them now. Let's go through an example of subscribing to one package (Cart, beta package). The complete list of required packages is provided below:

- Select your project, from **Projects** on the **Builder** home page.
- From **Administration** menu in the left navigation, go to **Subscriptions**.
- Use the **+ Subscription** button. You are then redirected to the **YaaS Market**.
- Click on **Beta Packages**. Beta packages are available free of charge and are intended for testing purposes in non-productive environments. They provide the same functionality as standard packages, but the number of requests or API calls per month is limited.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](View subscriptions)] ￼

Allow 10 seconds for processing and check in your project's **Administration** section in the Builder if the package is displayed under **Subscriptions**. If the package is not displayed, reload your browser's page.


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Add other subscriptions)] ￼

You need to subscribe to all **Checkout**, **Coupon Management**, **Customer Accounts**, **Order Management**, **Product Content** and **Site Management** packages. Follow the step 2 in order to subscribe to these packages.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Create a new YaaS Client)] ￼

Now that you have subscribed to these packages, your YaaS Project is now aware of them, but to be able to call the micro services in those packages, your YaaS Project needs to have a valid YaaS Client.  Create a new YaaS Client and select *all possible* required Scopes (permissions) while doing so. Follow the steps below:

- Select your project from **Projects**.
- In the left navigation panel, go to **Clients**.
- Use the **+ Client** button.
- Select all the scopes. Use the Next button to proceed to the Details section.
