[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Go to sign up page)]

First we need to create an account on the Gateway System.  The system will use your sap.com profile information to create the account.

Click this link in your browser: [Gateway Registration system](https://register.sapdevcenter.com/SUPSignForms).

> **Note:** In order to sign up for an account on the Gateway Demo System, you must have an account on **sap.com**.  To register for an account on sap.com, navigate to [http://sap.com](http://www.sap.com/index.html), and then click on the **person icon** in the upper left hand corner of the web page. Once your account is set up, you can continue to register.

You should see this page:

Verify all of your *User Information* on the web page.   Please be certain your email address is correct.  If this address is incorrect, please fix it in your sap.com user profile.

Next, read the Terms and Conditions, and check the box next to the line *I have read and understood the Terms and Conditions.*

When ready, click the **Register** button.

The screen will change and the word *Success* will appear.

Your username and a temporary password are also displayed on the registration screen.  The username is **User ID**, and you can click the button to reveal the temporary password.

This is an example of the registration confirmation email:
