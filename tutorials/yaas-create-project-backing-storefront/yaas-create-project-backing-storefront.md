title: Use Your Own YaaS Project to Back your Storefront.
description: By default, the StoreFront is wired to the YaaS Project default project (created by the StoreFront's own Team). This default project has already been wired up and populated with the Products (and Services) that you can browse. You will now use our own YaaS Project which you created earlier instead of the default one.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Set project ID and client ID)] ￼

Take note of the YaaS **Project's identifier** and the YaaS **Client's identifier** and place these as the `PROJECT_ID` and `CLIENT_ID` values in the `gruntfile.js` in the `folder(1)` directory which you created in the previous tutorials. This is the root directory of your `yaas-storefront` project.

- You Can find **Project's identifier** in the **Builder** under the **Administration** tab when you open your project.
