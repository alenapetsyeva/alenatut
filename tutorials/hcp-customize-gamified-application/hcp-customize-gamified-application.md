## Details
### You will learn  
In this tutorial, you will tweak the game mechanics of the HelpDesk application manually using the Gamification Workbench on the SAP Cloud Platform. You will increase the number of experience points the user receives for solving sample tickets and increase the total points for solving sample critical tickets. As a result of that change, you will also have to adapt the game levels.

update(engine.getPlayerById($playerid));
```

Click **Save**.
