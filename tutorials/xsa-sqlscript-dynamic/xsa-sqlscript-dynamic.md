## Prerequisites  
- **Proficiency:** Intermediate
- **Tutorials:** [Anonymous Blocks](http://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/xsa-sqlscript-anonymous.html)

## Next Steps
- [Using Execute Immediate](http://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/xsa-sqlscript-execute.html)

## Details
### You will learn  
In this exercise, you will learn the differences between dynamic SQL (EXEC, EXECUTE IMMEDIATE) and applying a dynamic filter.
**Please note - This tutorial is based on SPS11**

### Time to Complete
**10 Min**.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create new procedure)]

Right click on the procedures folder and choose **New**, then **Procedure**.

![new procedure](1.png)

Enter the name of the procedure as `get_product_by_filter`.  Click the drop down box for **Schema**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Change namespace)]

Change the namespace from `Undefined` to `dev602.procedures`. Add an input parameter named `im_product_filter_string`, type `varchar` with a length of 5000.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Edit procedure)]

Because dynamic SQL is not supported in "Read-only" procedures, you must remove the ""READS SQL DATA" keywords as shown here.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Insert the EXEC statements)]

Between the BEGIN and END statements, insert the EXEC statements as shown.  The completed code should look similar to this. If you do not wish to type this code, you can reference the solution web page at `http://<hostname>:51013/workshop/admin/ui/exerciseMaster/?workshop=dev602&sub=ex2_17`

  ```
  PROCEDURE "dev602.procedures::get_product_by_filter" (            IN im_product_filter_string VARCHAR(5000) ) LANGUAGE SQLSCRIPT SQL SECURITY INVOKER --DEFAULT SCHEMA <default_schema_name> ASBEGINEXEC 'SELECT count(*) FROM "dev602.data::MD.Products" where CATEGORY NOT IN (''Laser printers'')'    || :im_product_filter_string  ;END
  ```

Save the procedure

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Build your module)]

Use what you have learned already and perform a build on your `hdb` module. Then return to the HRTT page and invoke the procedure.

A new SQL tab will be opened. Add the filter string as `AND CATEGORY = ''Notebooks'''`

![new sql tab](8.png)

Click the **Run** button.  You will notice that you get no results from the call at all.  Also by using the EXEC statement, there is a possibility of SQL injection

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
